This mod adds a single item called "Time in a bottle". This item comes in handy when you want to speed up a process of crating, smelting etc.

It works by increasing the tickrate of a block.  It passively collects time while in your inventory which you can consume by right clicking a block with it. The first click requires 30 Seconds, the second 60, the third 120 the fourth 240 and the fifth 480. The speed at which the block ticks doubles with each click. The effect lasts 30 seconds. You can only have one in your inventory at a time.

This is a standalone item for Minecraft 1.12.2 from Random Things by: Lumien321. Original can be found
